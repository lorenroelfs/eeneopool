Hello Reddit. I apologize for the read as this is the first time I am posting something this long on Reddit and English is not my native language. On the evening of March 11th, 2019 I received an email from EA stating that I had been banned for cheating. I will not bother with long-winded excuses: I have simply never thought of cheating in the first place. TLDR: BFV anticheat is banning legitimate players while not doing anything to blatant cheaters. amp#x200B; I cannot understand Our goal is to monitor alld Battlefield 1942 servers globally and to produce player statistics All logos are the trademark & property of their owners and not Sports Reference LLC. We present them here for purely educational purposes. Our reasoning for presenting offensive logos. Battlefield is finally back on the right track of increased squad play and teamwork with V. With that being said, DICE really needs to put some emphasis back into letting the community build and develop their clans, teams, communities, whatever with their Platoon system that is currently literally pointless. It's pretty sad that this series has never had an actual worth while system that makes people actually want to group up from within their game or represent something.
