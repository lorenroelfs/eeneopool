Ok, so for years I've remembered one moment from a movie I saw as a kid. Late 90's/early 2000's. A bunch of people trapped in a house that's booby trapped, someone sets off a trap, and razor discs, maybe saw blades fly out of the wall. There may have been a minor scifi element to it but I can't remember. I know it's super vague, but if anyone has any ideas I'd definitely appreciate. Amy Marie Weber (born July 2, 1970) is an American actress, model, film producer, singer, and former professional wrestling valet.She is best known KOLOBOS surprised me. I thought it would be your run-of-the-mill Dead Teenager movie,but the movie went far beyond mere slasher conventions. The images are genuinely surreal,the script is smart and the deaths look seriously painful. So after several runs I believe I have mapped the two zones where monsters spawn. Here is the image detailing the expected amount of Gil (which should be how you track if you're capped or not by going to Menu during your exploration and comparing the gil amount there vs the one in the image): So basically stay within Zone 1 until you've collected 1,812 gil then move on to Zone 2 until you've collected a total of 4,688 gil and proceed to fight boss after.

Props to /u/auronku for bringing this to my attention but it seems like there's a possible bug in the Kolobos Reef exploration where the Abtu's drop 18 cakes a piece almost every kill  My guess is because its a "boss" mob in the Feeding Pool so must have the guaranteed cake drops from that tag. This makes it a great spot to farm if you've already stocked up on a lot of mats and your crafting is on cooldown. FYI: Got 198 cakes on my full clear when I tried. Worth noting that Flour doesn't.

I've been trying to finish Kolobos but every time I try to start the Grotto Entrance I get a connection error then I'm booted back to the main screen.

Nothing in the format guarantees that anyone will get to 12 wins, while the 12 wins reward being broadly advertised. For comparison, in poker tournaments 1 guy/girl will always take the first place. Wait, how do you know that there will be at least 1 guy who goes 12 wins? Nobody in this scammy format says that. Are you from the future? Lotto isn't advertised to children, that's what makes lotto a legal regulated non-scam. Lotto also isn't disguised as a video. So, I don't know if this works for everyone, or if this is even a problem for everyone.but when I run Kolobos Marsh Exploration it seems really sluggish.but if I toggle the minimap off, it seems to correct itself.
